Once upon a time there was a programmer. But he didn't ever use git! After all,
he was a good programmer and didn't need to.

But one day, he made a mistake and wrote buggy code. He searched for hours for
his bug, but couldn't figure it out.

In the end, he died, as the good programmer did.

A new programmer emerges, repeating this cycle.
